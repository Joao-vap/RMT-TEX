[C5/p132] - Markov chain. Monte Carlo (MCMC) originated with the dassic paper of Metropolis et al.
{1953), where it was used to simulate the distribution of states for a system of idealized
molecules. Not long after, another approach to molecular simulation was introduced (Alder
and Wamwright, 1959), in which the motion of the molecules was deterministic, following
Newton's laws of motion, which have an elegant formalization as Hamiltonian dynamics. For
finding the properties of bulk materials, these approaches are asymptotically equivalent,
since even in a deterministic simulation, each local region of the material experiences
effectively random influences from distant regions. Despite the large overlap in their
appli­cation areas, the MCMC and molecular dynamics approaches have continued to coexist in
the following decades (see Frenkel and Smit, 1996).

[C5/p123] - Note that the invariance of H under Hamiltonian dynamics means that a Hamiltonian
trajectory will (if simulated exactly) move within a hypersurface of constant probability
density.

> Real spectra of large real asymmetric random matrices

It is almost impossible to imagine a quantitative field,
in which a diagonalization of non-symmetric matrices is
not used. Following the pioneering works of Wigner [1]
and Dyson [2], spectra of random matrices have been
intensively studied in physics and mathematics. Gini-
bre initiated studies of random matrices lacking symme-
tries [3], but real matrices turned out to be the most
difficult path on the Dyson threefold way [4], and it took
more than 40 years to pave the way for fully solving the
real Ginibre ensemble [5–13].

> A frist Course in random matrix theory

In many circumstances, the matrices that are encountered are large, and with no particular
structure. Physicist Eugene Wigner postulated that one can often replace a large complex
(but deterministic) matrix by a typical element of a certain ensemble of random matrices.
This bold proposal was made in the context of the study of large complex atomic nuclei,
where the “matrix” is the Hamiltonian of the system, which is a Hermitian matrix describ-
ing all the interactions between the neutrons and protons contained in the nucleus. At the
time, these interactions were not well known; but even if they had been, the task of diag-
onalizing the Hamiltonian to find the energy levels of the nucleus was so formidable that
Wigner looked for an alternative.
