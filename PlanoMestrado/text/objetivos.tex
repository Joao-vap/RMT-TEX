This MD research proposal has as its main goals

\begin{itemize}
\item Introduce the student to asymptotic techniques in random matrix theory and related areas.
\item Develop a scientific overview of recent developments concerning asymptotic expansions of partition functions of random matrix with complex eigenvalues.
\item Explore how phase transitions in the limiting spectrum of the studied random matrix models reflect on different asymptotic behavior of the associated partition function.
\end{itemize}

The proposed student is acquainted with the basic theory of random matrices, as well as with the application of numerical methods to their study. During this project, the student will continue exploring numerical venues, as well as develop various rigorous mathematical skills necessary to the study of random matrices.

The development will follow the usual route of research for a Masters Thesis in Mathematics. The student will study the relevant literature on the area, and will have regular meetings with the supervisor. Time permitting, towards the end of the project the student will explore whether available asymptotic formulas for the correlation kernel of some normal matrix models can be explored to also yield novel asymptotic expansions of the associated partition functions.
