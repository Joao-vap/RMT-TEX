This project requires some knowledge in a few mathematical areas. Some of them are real and complex analysis, functional analysis, measure theory and correlated courses. All of those are provided at the necessary level by the Masters Program in Mathematics at the ICMC - USP. All required background is expected to be gained in the regular courses in the first terms of the program, as usual. Some other disciplines may be followed in summer programs at various math programs in the country, as necessary. Furthermore, the student has had a year of experience in Random Matrix Theory at an undergrad level with a FAPESP fellowship supervised by the same researcher, in which some experience and general knowledge of the field has been gained.
