This project requires some knowledge in a few mathematical areas. Some of them are real and complex analysis, functional analysis, measure theory and correlated courses. All of those are provided at the necessary leal ate the Masters Program in Mathematics at the ICMC - USP. All required background is expected to be gained in the regular courses in the first terms of the program, as usual. Some other disciplines may be coursed during the summer courses at the same institute. Furthermore, te student has had a year of experience in Random Matrix Theory at an undergrad level within a FAPESP fellowship supervised by the same researcher in witch some experience and general knowledge of the field has been gained.
